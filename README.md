# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict **heart disease** using machine learning models trained on clinical data. We explore different classification models to find the most effective approach.

**Dataset Used:** [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)  
**Best Model Accuracy:** 97% (K-Nearest Neighbors with Hyperparameter Tuning)  

## ⚙️ Features
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
✅ **Correlation Analysis & Feature Selection**  
✅ **Model Training & Comparison**  
✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
✅ **Evaluation Using Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve**  

## 🏗️ Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (Best Performance: 97%)
- **Random Forest**

## 📈 Results & Findings
🔹 **Correlation Analysis** identified key features such as **CP, thalach, and slope**.  
🔹 **Random Forest initially achieved 100% accuracy**, but tuning revealed potential overfitting.  
🔹 **KNN with hyperparameter tuning provided the best accuracy (97%)**, balancing performance and generalization.
